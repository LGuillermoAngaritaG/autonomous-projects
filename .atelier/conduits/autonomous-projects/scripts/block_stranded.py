"""Move every task stranded in 02_in-progress/ to 05_blocked/ with a note.

Success in work-one-todo moves a task to 03_to-review/, so any *.md still
sitting in 02_in-progress/ after the advance loop means the loop gave up: the
reviewer never returned DONE within the retry cap, or a crash/timeout/usage
throttle cut the run off. Left there, the task is silently retried every tick,
burning quota with no note for the human. This moves it out, out loud.

Stdout contract (always exit 0): one line per file moved to 05_blocked/, or a
single "blocked: none" when nothing was stranded:
    blocked: <path>
    blocked: <path>
    blocked: none
